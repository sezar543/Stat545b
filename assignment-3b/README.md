## BC Liquor Shiny App

## Assignment 3

Click [here](https://sezar543.shinyapps.io/bcl-shiny/) to see the URL where the app is hosted.

For this assignment, *Option A - BC Liquor app* is selected. I implemented the following features:
1) shinyjs::colourInput()  is used so that the user can choose the colors of bars, *red* and *whine*, on the plot.
2) An image of a BC liquor store is included on the titlePanel using *img(src = " ")*.
3) The ouputs *text results*, *plot* and *table* are placed on separate tabs.

## Assignment 5
For this assignment, *Option C – Shiny App* is selected. I implemented the following feature:
- User can filter "Alcohol Content".

Also, more texts and directions are included to make this App more user-freindly and make its porpuse clear.

### Acknowledgements
